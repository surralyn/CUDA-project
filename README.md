# CUDA-project

Codings I did to get better understanding of CUDA programming.

## Reduction Method Optimization

Experiments on reduction optimization based on official tutorial.

## Constant Memory

Example of convolution that shows how constant memory accelerate calculation.

## NMS optimization

An adaptive method that combine 2 different methods' advantages, having 2~6 times faster performance than PyTorch nms on CPU.
